# Bot Hive — way of working

Canonical project rules for **any agent** (AI or human) working on bot-hive. Agent-neutral by design: Claude Code reads this via the `CLAUDE.md` pointer; Codex/Cursor/Aider/Gemini and any future agent should read this directly. Format-neutral guidance for the hive workflow itself lives in `hive/HIVE.md`.

Per-machine local-dev state (in-progress setup notes) lives in `tasks/local-dev-state.md` — never in this file.

---

## Identity (read first)

Every agent session has a unique handle. **Two sessions on the same machine get different handles** — identity is per-session, not per-machine.

### On session start

1. **Auto-pick a handle from the curated list** (random selection):

   ```
   buzz, scout, forager, drone, comb, pollen, nectar, waggle,
   sparrow, finch, robin, wren, fox, otter, badger, mole,
   squirrel, hare, sentinel, pilot, ranger, watcher, kestrel,
   falcon, tern, jay
   ```

2. **Check for collisions** with handles already in active use:
   - Scan recent commit trailers: `git log --grep "Bot: " -n 50` — extract the `Bot: <handle>` values.
   - Scan in-progress tickets: read every `hive/in-progress/*.md` and extract the `Assigned to:` field's handle.
   - If your random pick appears in either set, **re-pick**. Repeat up to 10 times.
   - If 10 rolls all collide (extremely unlikely), append a numeric suffix: `scout-2`.

3. **Hold the handle in memory** for the session. **Do not** persist it to `git config` or any file. Each session is a fresh roll.

4. **Announce** "I'm `<handle>`" to the user so they can tell sessions apart.

### Override

If `BOT_HIVE_HANDLE` environment variable is set (e.g., `BOT_HIVE_HANDLE=billy`), use that value verbatim — skip the random pick and the collision check. Lets the human lock a session to a specific name.

### Where the handle appears

- `Assigned to:` ticket field (e.g., `Assigned to: nectar (claude-opus-4-7)`).
- `Bot:` commit trailer (alongside `Model:` and `Trigger:`).
- `hive/events.log` entries.
- Live board UI as a colored badge on each ticket card (color is deterministic via `robotColor(handle)`).

### Existing `git config bot-hive.handle` values

Handles set under the prior convention (`git config bot-hive.handle <name>`) are **deprecated but harmless**. Agents should ignore them. Run `git config --unset bot-hive.handle` to clean up if desired — not required.

Full convention discussion: see `hive/HIVE.md` "Bot identity" section.

## Where work goes — all commits via PR + auto-merge

Branch protection on `main` rejects direct pushes for any change. Every commit — source code, `hive/` ticket moves, doc edits, anything — flows through a PR gated by the `ci` status check.

The unified flow:

```bash
git checkout -b hv-XXX-<slug>
# ... edit files ...
git commit -am "..."
git push -u origin hv-XXX-<slug>
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

`--auto` queues the merge and fires it the moment CI goes green. No manual step. Total ceremony per change: ~2-3 min of wall time (CI run), ~5s of agent interaction.

### Conceptually: still two lanes

The mental split between coordination metadata and source code is still useful — it determines what the change is *about*, even though both flow through PRs:

| Kind of work | Files | What CI does |
|---|---|---|
| Coordination metadata | `hive/`, this `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`, agent-shim files like `CLAUDE.md` | Runs the full suite, passes trivially (~2 min) since no source changed. |
| Source code | `src/`, `tests/`, `migrations/`, configs, `package.json`, `.github/` | Substantive gate — typecheck/lint/test/build all must pass. |

If CI minutes ever become a concern, we can `paths-ignore` filter the workflow to skip hive-only PRs. Not worth the complexity today.

### Setup details

See `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` for the exact GitHub settings, the `gh api` automation script, and the verification checklist.

---

## Working in parallel — the swarm protocol

Multiple agents (and humans) work this repo at once. Coordination is **not** centralized — there's no coordinator service. Each agent reads the shared environment (the git tree) and follows local rules. Coordination emerges.

### On every session start

1. `git pull` (subscribe).
2. Read `hive/focus.md` — that's the standing order. (Empty / missing = "anything in backlog.")
3. Tail the last ~50 lines of `hive/events.log` to see what other agents have done recently.
4. Auto-pick a handle (per the Identity section above). Announce it.

### When the human says "do FS-X" or "work on HV-X"

The agent they're chatting with **also writes that to `hive/focus.md`** so the other agents pick up the same intent on their next session start. The chat message is a hint; `focus.md` is the source of truth across agents.

### Picking what to claim

DAG-walk with cohesion preference:

1. Read `focus.md`.
2. Collect tickets in scope (named FS, named ticket, or all of `backlog/`).
3. Filter out: in-progress, blocked, anything with unfinished `Blocked by:`.
4. From the available leaves, pick the one that **unblocks the most downstream tickets**. Tie-break: lowest ticket ID.
5. Claim it.

This is deterministic enough that two agents usually pick different leaves. If they collide, the git push lock breaks the tie — loser pulls and re-runs.

### Pre-action pull — never operate on stale state

A session that started an hour ago has a clone that's an hour out of date. Other agents (and humans) may have pushed conventions, claimed tickets, merged PRs in the meantime. Acting on stale state causes ID collisions, missed convention updates, and edits to files that have moved.

**Rule:** every meaningful action — claiming a ticket, opening a PR, pushing a branch, editing the canonical docs — is preceded by `git pull --rebase` against `origin/main`.

Cheapest correct version of this is a **pre-commit pull**: before any `git commit` that's about to be pushed, run `git pull --rebase` first. If main has advanced, you rebase locally; if the rebase is clean (no conflict markers), continue and push. If the rebase conflicts, fall back to the conflict-response policy below — never guess merges.

In practice:

```bash
# Before claiming a ticket or pushing any branch
git fetch
git pull --rebase   # safe; aborts cleanly if there's nothing to do

# Then your normal flow
git commit -am "..."
git push -u origin <branch>
```

This is the swarm-aligned default: cheap, no daemon, no real-time bus, no new files. Each commit is one extra round-trip to `origin` — negligible at our scale, and it's the exact same primitive (`git pull`) that already does the subscribe step on session start.

Other options were considered and rejected:

- **Heartbeat file** that bumps a timestamp on every push — adds a file, only signals via commits, no advantage over pre-commit pull.
- **Push notification (webhook → bot bus)** — requires real-time infrastructure that the swarm protocol explicitly rejects.
- **Polled `git fetch` daemon** — drifts from "files-and-git only," adds a timer, no obvious win.

The pre-commit pull is the durable choice; the others can come later if scale demands it.

### Publishing events

After every meaningful state transition (claim, in-review, accepted, rejected, blocked, reclaim), append a one-line entry to `hive/events.log`:

```
2026-05-05T15:42:00Z HV-031 done HV-032,HV-033 unblocked nectar
```

Format: `<ISO timestamp> <ticket-id> <action> [<unblocked-list>] <handle>`. The unblocked-list is comma-separated ticket IDs that just became available. Other agents tail this on session start to catch handoffs without re-walking the DAG.

### Stale claims

Every commit an agent makes against an in-progress ticket also updates the ticket's `**Last touched:**` field with the current ISO timestamp. If an agent looks at an in-progress ticket and `Last touched:` is older than **2 hours**, the ticket is stale — that agent may reclaim it (move back to `backlog/` with a `Reclaim reason:`) or take it over (update `Assigned to:`, refresh `Last touched:`). Append the reclaim to `events.log`.

### Per-FS architecture & decisions log

Each `hive/feature-sets/feature-set-NNN-<slug>.md` carries an **`## Architecture & decisions`** section that bots and humans append to as design choices accumulate. It's the swarm's institutional memory for that feature set — captures the *why*, not just the *what*. Future agents working in that FS read it on session start and don't re-litigate settled questions.

**Entry format** (compact ADR-style; ~10 lines per decision):

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line headline> (<bot-handle>)

**Choice:** <what we picked>

**Rejected:** <what we considered and why we didn't pick it>

**Why:** <substrate-portable rationale>

**Implications:** <what now changes in the code or convention>

**Reference:** <HV-XXX / PR #N>
```

**Append** an entry whenever you make a non-trivial design choice in an FS. "Non-trivial" = anything you'd debate in a senior code review; pure mechanical edits don't qualify.

**Read** the relevant FS's section on session start, **after** `focus.md` and `events.log`. If `focus.md` names an FS, that FS's decisions are mandatory pre-reading.

**Append-only** by convention. Never edit or delete past decisions — that's audit honesty. If two bots append simultaneously and conflict, both entries land (auto-rebase orders them by timestamp).

### When you need to ask the human

Append to `hive/questions-for-human.md` rather than blocking on chat. Format: dated heading + question. The human reads on their cadence.

### Conflict response

| Failure | Action |
|---|---|
| Push to main rejected (non-fast-forward) | `git pull --rebase`, retry. |
| Branch rebase against main produces no conflict markers | `git push --force-with-lease`, let CI re-run. |
| Branch rebase produces real conflict markers | **Stop. Don't guess.** Move ticket to `blocked/`, `Failure mode: merge-conflict`, comment PR, append to `events.log`, surface to human. |
| CI fails on PR | Read CI output, attempt fix, push fix, wait. **Two attempts max.** Then `blocked/` with `Failure mode: failed-tests`. |
| Stale claim (`Last touched:` > 2h) | Reclaim per the rule above. |
| ID collision (two agents picked same `HV-N`) | Loser-by-push-time renumbers. The one whose work is shipped or further-along keeps the ID. |
| **Doc collision** (two agents edited same coordination doc) | Reconcile by structural correctness — keep the file's documented heading hierarchy and conventions; merge useful content from the conflicting edit into the appropriate place. Never silently lose work. |

The hard rule across all failures: **agents auto-resolve trivial git mechanics, but escalate substantive conflicts to humans.** Agents NEVER attempt to merge or guess code resolution.

### Always pull before claiming or committing to main

Stale local main = guaranteed push conflict + collision risk. The `git pull` is the subscribe step in our pub/sub model — it's how you find out what other agents have done.

## Local dev

- Postgres 16+ native on port 5432 (no Docker).
- `npm run dev` starts the Next.js dev server.
- `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test` before any PR.
- Migrations: `npm run db:migrate` against local DB.
- See `README.md` for full setup.
- Per-machine in-progress setup state lives in `tasks/local-dev-state.md`.

---

## Testing rules

- **DB-backed tests use the transactional fixture.** Import `test` from `@/lib/test-db` instead of vitest directly. Each test gets a `tx` parameter — a Drizzle transaction that auto-rolls back on test end. No data ever commits, no `afterEach` cleanup needed, no parallelism collisions.
- **No `Date.now()` in test data.** Use stable, explicit IDs. The transactional isolation makes collision impossible by construction; reaching for wall-clock or `Math.random()` to "ensure uniqueness" is a code smell.
- **`randomUUID()` is allowed for unique tokens** (test user IDs, repo names) where collision needs to be cryptographically zero — but never to compensate for missing isolation.
- **Production functions that touch the DB should accept `db: DbHandle = defaultDb`** as an optional parameter, so tests can pass `tx` and have reads see the test's uncommitted writes. See `src/lib/projects.ts` for the pattern.
- **Functions with no DB access** (pure logic, mockable IO) don't need the fixture or the DI parameter. `src/lib/access.test.ts` is the example — it `vi.mock`s `@/db` entirely.

---

## Deploy

- Prod runs on Render at `https://bot-hive-j0ax.onrender.com`. Auto-deploys from `main`.
- Staging environment is being designed in HV-035 (FS-007). Until it lands, prod is the only deploy target.
- Deploy lessons captured in `tasks/lessons.md` — read before any deploy work.
